## Beautiful House in the Heart of East Portland

We have one more room available at my beautiful house in SE Laurelhurst. We live right near the park and very close to public transportation and bike lanes. 

Starting in September we will have available the nicest room in the house. It is a big private bedroom with three closets and shared bathroom (only one more person uses that bathroom), shared use of kitchen and living area, Wi-Fi, and free washer and dryer. I’m asking for $700 plus utilities. Utilities could be from $50 to around $80 depending on the time of the year. 

There are two outside porch/patio areas and fenced back yard. There are 5 bedrooms upstairs with 3 full bathrooms and one big kitchen. And 2 bedrooms in the basement with one full bathroom and one full kitchen. The room that we have available is the biggest one on the upstairs floor. It has a lot of light and space to have a desk if needed. 

We share the house between 3 adults upstairs (including you) and 2 adults in the basement apartment downstairs (we share the patios with them). Two kids and one dog live in the house every other week but they will be gone this winter. We will have the kids’s rooms to sublet from October 2020 to March 2021.

· Move in requires: first and last month's rent, security deposit of $600 and a month to month lease.
· Quality of life: We seek somebody interested in having a more just world and who is self-motivated, and considerate of others. We want this creative living situation to contribute to each person's quality of life.
. Community: We would like somebody that would like to share house meals once in a while and is good with communication with the rest of the housemates. 
· Pet situation: We already have 1 dog every other week but we may consider another pet if it relates well with dogs.
· Location: home is 1 block from lovely Laurelhurst Park, 5 blocks to whole foods, cafes and pubs; a 15 minute drive/bus to downtown, and really easy bus connections to the entire metro area.

Available August 1st
